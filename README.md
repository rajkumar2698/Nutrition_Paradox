#  Nutrition Paradox: A Global View on Obesity and Malnutrition

##  Project Overview:
This project analyzes the global **nutrition paradox**, where **obesity and malnutrition coexist across different regions of the world**.  
Using **WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) data**, the project explores trends, regional patterns, demographic differences, and uncertainty in estimates.

The entire analysis is implemented in a **single Jupyter Notebook** using Python.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SQLite (for database integration)
- WHO GHO API
- PowerBi
---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: **World Health Organization (WHO) – Global Health Observatory**
- Indicators used:
  - **Adult obesity**
  - Child & adolescent obesity
  - **Adult malnutrition**
  - Child & adolescent malnutrition
- Time period analyzed: **2012 – 2022**

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Load data from WHO GHO API  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature engineering (age group, confidence interval width, risk levels)  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
5. SQL integration using SQLite 
6. Comparative analysis between obesity and malnutrition  

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations
The notebook includes **25 visualizations**, covering:
- Distribution of obesity levels  
- Global obesity trends over time  
- Regional comparison of malnutrition  
- Gender-based and age-group-based analysis  
- Regional trends (Africa focus)  
- Confidence interval (uncertainty) analysis

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `Nutrition_Paradox.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab  
3. Run all cells from top to bottom  
4. (Optional) Configure SQL Lite3 if database connectivity is required  

---

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Obesity rates are increasing globally, especially in higher-income regions  
- Malnutrition remains prevalent in Africa and South-East Asia  
- Strong contrast between regions highlights the global nutrition paradox  
- Gender and age groups show distinct nutrition patterns
